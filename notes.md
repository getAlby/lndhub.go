# Rebuilding LndHub

Goal of this project is to build a simple accounting system with a [LndHub](https://github.com/BlueWallet/LndHub) compatible API that focusses on simplicity, maintainability and ease of deployment.

[LndHub](https://github.com/BlueWallet/LndHub) is a simple accounting system for LND. It allows users to send and receive lightning payments. Through the API people can access funds through a shared lightning node. (see overview.png diagram)

Some design goals:

* No runtime dependencies (all compiled into a single, simple deployable executable)
* Focus on offchain payments (no onchain transactions supported)
* Plan for multiple node backends ([LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/) gRPC interface is the first implementation) (also through Tor)
* Admin panel for better Ops
* All configuration stored in the DB
* Using constraints and functions in the DB to prevent inconsistent data
